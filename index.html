      Jananayagan is an upcoming Tamil political action drama starring Vijay and
      directed by H. Vinoth. The film has attracted massive attention as it is
      widely expected to be one of Vijay’s final movies before his full-time
      entry into politics. True to its title, which means “Leader of the
      People,” the movie is expected to focus on themes such as governance,
      social justice, corruption, and the power of the common man. Known for his
      realistic and issue driven storytelling, H. Vinoth is likely to present a
      grounded narrative with strong political undertones rather than a typical
      commercial approach
